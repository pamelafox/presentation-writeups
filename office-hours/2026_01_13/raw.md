How does Azure manage the context window? I know it has a large context capacity, but I'm working with small models and I don't know how to maintain a long conversation with a small context window.

I have a project where this is an issue and it is not easy to deal with it. Using the foundry sdk with single agent. I am not willing to overhaul my code and change everything. In that case what would be the best way to deal with this? Still talking about context.

Thanks. Yes summarization approach to start with
For example I need to do anomaly detection on top of data and the context is dynamic can be large or small 
Would be cool as it has support for microsoft agent framework, to see AGUI in action 
pablocotan — 11:38 AM
Happy new year! First question of the year from my side 🙂

We are seing in several projects and tools the usage of a “harness” for long running agents.
An article that discuss this is this one https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-harnesses-for-long-running-agents

Could you please comment on this in the context of creating a team of agents with agent framework to solve complex tasks (many steps that require testing of each of them, with many specs), as when we create a digital employee or expert that executes a task.

I’m currently working on integrating MCP into my chatbot. MCP server is open-source and implemented in Java, while the rest of my chatbot is written in Python, so I’m building a Python-based MCP client. I’m running into some unexpected behavior when testing the integration in Streamlit. Without getting into the details, I’m curious whether anyone has strong opinions on Streamlit and, if so, what alternative frameworks you’d recommend if I’d prefer not to use Claude Code.

@Pamela Fox Yes I am thinking about using mem0 and ai search and perhaps adding neo4j. I actually have a branch where I have a working approach using mem0 with AI search. Thinking if what I am doing here is good enough vs this approach with hindsight. I will share my repo soon
