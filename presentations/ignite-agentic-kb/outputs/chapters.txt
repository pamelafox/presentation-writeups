Summary:
This video session presents an in-depth overview of building intelligent agentic applications using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combined with Azure AI Search. The presenters explain the fundamentals of RAG, demonstrate hybrid search techniques that combine keyword and vector search with re-ranking for improved results, and introduce advanced agentic retrieval features in Azure AI Search knowledge bases. They also showcase integration with Foundry IQ for unified agent knowledge layers and provide demos illustrating minimal, low, and medium retrieval reasoning efforts, including the use of web and SharePoint as knowledge sources.
